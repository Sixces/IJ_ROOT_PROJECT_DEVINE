/*
Assignment 3: This assignment is about building an Array that is sorted from its inception.
We have Arrays.Sort that can sort an existing array into order. But to understand how that actually works we need to manually perform a sort operation
An InsertSort will apply sorting logic from the very first value we place into an array.
Lets say we have a series of values to input into an array (4, 13,2, 9,5)
Here is our array: _ _ _ _ _ _
Generally, an insertSort is setup with a for loop. Lets call its counter "i" for simplicity "i" is set to the value of count-1.
Remember what count is, its used to represent the number of values present in an array(since they are rarely totally full) 
Count-1 would put us at the actual address of the last populated array element.
Each value as it comes into the array comes in from the right hand side, the first value it encounters we do a compare to 
newvalue < array[i] tests last value to see if new value is less than it. Also, we need to make sure i>=0 or we will run off the front of the array!
We can manually figure out the small sample data above will make a sorted array that is 2 4 5 9 13, but how to we get it into that format from what we have?
4 is inserted first, count would be 0 at that time, using the logic test above that for the loop to keep going the newval has to be less than the last item 
in the array and "i" has to be more than or equal to 0. 
Right now, there are no values in the array to test less than to, since "i" is count-1(0-1) so -1 the loop should fail. What now? Loop failure means you are at an 
acceptable address for insertion, the insertion will be done at [i+1], in this case [-1 + 1] or 0. 4 will go to array[0]
4 _ _ _ _ _  ------ 13 is next up
4 13 _ _ _ _ ------- 2 is next
2 4 13 _ _ _ -------- 9 is next
2 4 9 13 _ _ ------- 5 is last
2 4 5 9 13 _
An insertion sort will ONLY work on an array with at least 1 empty place in it, a full array will fail at insertion as i+1 will run off the edge of it.
